<td align="center">Noise detrimentally affects quantum computations so that they not only become less accurate but also easier to simulate classically as systems scale up. We construct a classical simulation algorithm, LOWESA (low weight efficient simulation algorithm), for estimating expectation values of noisy parameterised quantum circuits. It combines previous results on spectral analysis of parameterised circuits with Pauli back-propagation and recent ideas for simulations of noisy random circuits. We show, under some conditions on the circuits and mild assumptions on the noise, that LOWESA gives an efficient, polynomial algorithm in the number of qubits (and depth), with approximation error that vanishes exponentially in the physical error rate and a controllable cut-off parameter. We also discuss the practical limitations of the method for circuit classes with correlated parameters and its scaling with decreasing error rates.</td>

<td align="center">This paper introduces a new large-scale image restoration dataset, called HQ-50K, which contains 50,000 high-quality images with rich texture details and semantic diversity. We analyze existing image restoration datasets from five different perspectives, including data scale, resolution, compression rates, texture details, and semantic coverage. However, we find that all of these datasets are deficient in some aspects. In contrast, HQ-50K considers all of these five aspects during the data curation process and meets all requirements. We also present a new Degradation-Aware Mixture of Expert (DAMoE) model, which enables a single model to handle multiple corruption types and unknown levels. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HQ-50K consistently improves the performance on various image restoration tasks, such as super-resolution, denoising, dejpeg, and deraining. Furthermore, our proposed DAMoE, trained on our \dataset, outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models designed for multiple restoration tasks and levels.

<td align="center">Emerging psychopathology studies are showing that patterns of changes in emotional state -- emotion dynamics -- are associated with overall well-being and mental health. More recently, there has been some work in tracking emotion dynamics through one's utterances, allowing for data to be collected on a larger scale across time and people. However, several questions about how emotion dynamics change with age, especially in children, and when determined through children's writing, remain unanswered. In this work, we use both a lexicon and a machine learning based approach to quantify characteristics of emotion dynamics determined from poems written by children of various ages. We show that both approaches point to similar trends: consistent increasing intensities for some emotions (e.g., anger, fear, joy, sadness, arousal, and dominance) with age and a consistent decreasing valence with age. We also find increasing emotional variability, rise rates (i.e., emotional reactivity), and recovery rates (i.e., emotional regulation) with age. These results act as a useful baselines for further research in how patterns of emotions expressed by children change with age, and their association with mental health.</td>

<td align="center">The high frequency communication bands (mmWave and sub-THz) promise tremendous data rates, however, they also have very high power consumption which is particularly significant for battery-power-limited user-equipment (UE). In this context, we design an energy aware band assignment system which reduces the power consumption while also achieving a target sum rate of M in T time-slots. We do this by using 1) Rate forecaster(s); 2) Channel forecaster(s) which forecasts T direct multistep ahead using a stacked (long short term memory) LSTM architecture. We propose an iterative rate updating algorithm which updates the target rate based on current rate and future predicted rates in a frame. The proposed approach is validated on the publicly available `DeepMIMO' dataset. Research findings shows that the rate forecaster based approach performs better than the channel forecaster. Furthermore, LSTM based predictions outperforms well celebrated Transformer predictions in terms of NRMSE and NMAE. Research findings reveals that the power consumption with this approach is ~ 300 mW lower compared to a greedy band assignment at a 1.5Gb/s target rate.</td>

<td align="center">A two-player symmetric zero-sum game is transitive if for any pure strategies $x$, $y$, $z$, if $x$ is better than $y$, and $y$ is better than $z$, then $x$ is better than $z$. It was recently observed that the Elo rating fails at preserving transitive relations among strategies and therefore cannot correctly extract the transitive component of a game. Our first contribution is to show that the Elo rating actually does preserve transitivity when computed in the right space. Precisely, using a suitable invertible mapping $\varphi$, we first apply $\varphi$ to the game, then compute Elo ratings, then go back to the original space by applying $\varphi^{-1}$. We provide a characterization of transitive games as a weak variant of ordinal potential games with additively separable potential functions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce the concept of transitivity order, the minimum number of invertible mappings required to transform the payoff of a transitive game into (differences of) its potential function. The transitivity order is a tool to classify transitive games, with Elo games being an example of transitive games of order one. Most real-world games have both transitive and non-transitive (cyclic) components, and we use our analysis of transitivity to extract the transitive (potential) component of an arbitrary game. We link transitivity to the known concept of sign-rank: transitive games have sign-rank two; arbitrary games may have higher sign-rank. Using a neural network-based architecture, we learn a decomposition of an arbitrary game into transitive and cyclic components that prioritises capturing the sign pattern of the game. In particular, a transitive game always has just one component in its decomposition, the potential component. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our methodology using both toy examples and empirical data from real-world games.</td>

<td align="center">This paper is motivated by the analysis of a survey study of college student wellbeing before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistical challenge in well-being survey studies lies in that outcome variables are often recorded in different scales, be it continuous, binary, or ordinal. The presence of mixed data complicates the assessment of the associations between them while adjusting for covariates. In our study, of particular interest are the associations between college students' wellbeing and other mental health measures and how other risk factors moderate these associations during the pandemic. To this end, we propose a unifying framework for studying partial association between mixed data. This is achieved by defining a unified residual using the surrogate method. The idea is to map the residual randomness to the same continuous scale, regardless of the original scales of outcome variables. It applies to virtually all commonly used models for covariate adjustments. We demonstrate the validity of using such defined residuals to assess partial association. In particular, we develop a measure that generalizes classical Kendall's tau in the sense that it can size both partial and marginal associations. More importantly, our development advances the theory of the surrogate method developed in recent years by showing that it can be used without requiring outcome variables having a latent variable structure. The use of our method in the well-being survey analysis reveals (i) significant moderation effects (i.e., the difference between partial and marginal associations) of some key risk factors; and (ii) an elevated moderation effect of physical health, loneliness, and accommodation after the onset of COVID-19.</td>

The goal of this study is to see if there are any correlations between an elderly user's preferred handlebar pose and various demographic indicators, self-rated mobility for tasks requiring postural change, and biomechanical markers. For simplicity, we consider only the case where the handlebar is positioned directly in front of the user, as this confines the relevant body kinematics to a 2D sagittal plane. Previous eldercare devices have been constructed to position a handlebar in various poses in space. Our work augments these devices and adds to the body of knowledge by assessing how the handlebar should be positioned based on data on actual elderly people instead of simulations.</td>

<td align="center">Active processes drive and guide biological dynamics across scales -- from subcellular cytoskeletal remodelling, through tissue development in embryogenesis, to population-level bacterial colonies expansion. In each of these, biological functionality requires collective flows to occur while self-organized structures are protected; however, the mechanisms by which active flows can spontaneously constrain their dynamics to preserve structure have not previously been explained. By studying collective flows and defect dynamics in active nematic films, we demonstrate the existence of a self-constraint -- a two-way, spontaneously arising relationship between activity-driven isosurfaces of flow boundaries and mesoscale nematic structures. Our results show that self-motile defects are tightly constrained to viscometric surfaces -- contours along which vorticity and strain-rate balance. This in turn reveals that self-motile defects break mirror symmetry when they move along a single viscometric surface, in contrast with expectations. This is explained by an interdependence between viscometric surfaces and bend walls -- elongated narrow kinks in the orientation field. Although we focus on extensile nematic films, numerical results show the constraint holds whenever activity leads to motile half-charge defects. This mesoscale cross-field self-constraint offers a new framework for tackling complex 3D active turbulence, designing dynamic control into biomimetic materials, and understanding how biological systems can employ active stress for dynamic self-organization.</td>

<td align="center">Cardiac digital twins provide a physics and physiology informed framework to deliver predictive and personalized medicine. However, high-fidelity multi-scale cardiac models remain a barrier to adoption due to their extensive computational costs and the high number of model evaluations needed for patient-specific personalization. Artificial Intelligence-based methods can make the creation of fast and accurate whole-heart digital twins feasible. In this work, we use Latent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (LNODEs) to learn the temporal pressure-volume dynamics of a heart failure patient. Our surrogate model based on LNODEs is trained from 400 3D-0D whole-heart closed-loop electromechanical simulations while accounting for 43 model parameters, describing single cell through to whole organ and cardiovascular hemodynamics. The trained LNODEs provides a compact and efficient representation of the 3D-0D model in a latent space by means of a feedforward fully-connected Artificial Neural Network that retains 3 hidden layers with 13 neurons per layer and allows for 300x real-time numerical simulations of the cardiac function on a single processor of a standard laptop. This surrogate model is employed to perform global sensitivity analysis and robust parameter estimation with uncertainty quantification in 3 hours of computations, still on a single processor. We match pressure and volume time traces unseen by the LNODEs during the training phase and we calibrate 4 to 11 model parameters while also providing their posterior distribution. This paper introduces the most advanced surrogate model of cardiac function available in the literature and opens new important venues for parameter calibration in cardiac digital twins.</td>

<td align="center">In modern scientific experiments, we frequently encounter data that have large dimensions, and in some experiments, such high dimensional data arrive sequentially rather than full data being available all at a time. We develop multiple testing procedures with simultaneous control of false discovery and nondiscovery rates when $m$-variate data vectors $\mathbf{X}_1, \mathbf{X}_2, \dots$ are observed sequentially or in groups and each coordinate of these vectors leads to a hypothesis testing. Existing multiple testing methods for sequential data uses fixed stopping boundaries that do not depend on sample size, and hence, are quite conservative when the number of hypotheses $m$ is large. We propose sequential tests based on adaptive stopping boundaries that ensure shrinkage of the continue sampling region as the sample size increases. Under minimal assumptions on the data sequence, we first develop a test based on an oracle test statistic such that both false discovery rate (FDR) and false nondiscovery rate (FNR) are nearly equal to some prefixed levels with strong control. Under a two-group mixture model assumption, we propose a data-driven stopping and decision rule based on local false discovery rate statistic that mimics the oracle rule and guarantees simultaneous control of FDR and FNR asymptotically as $m$ tends to infinity. Both the oracle and the data-driven stopping times are shown to be finite (i.e., proper) with probability 1 for all finite $m$ and converge to a finite constant as $m$ grows to infinity. Further, we compare the data-driven test with the existing gap rule proposed in He and Bartroff (2021) and show that the ratio of the expected sample sizes of our method and the gap rule tends to zero as $m$ goes to infinity. Extensive analysis of simulated datasets as well as some real datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed tests over some existing methods.</td>

<td align="center">Mode-locked lasers (MLLs) have enabled ultrafast sciences and technologies by generating ultrashort pulses with peak powers substantially exceeding their average powers. Recently, tremendous efforts have been focused on realizing integrated MLLs not only to address the challenges associated with their size and power demand, but also to enable transforming the ultrafast technologies into nanophotonic chips, and ultimately to unlock their potential for a plethora of applications. However, till now the prospect of integrated MLLs driving ultrafast nanophotonic circuits has remained elusive because of their typically low peak powers, lack of controllability, and challenges with integration with appropriate nanophotonic platforms. Here, we overcome these limitations by demonstrating an electrically-pumped actively MLL in nanophotonic lithium niobate based on its hybrid integration with a III-V semiconductor optical amplifier. Our MLL generates $\sim$4.8 ps optical pulses around 1065 nm at a repetition rate of $\sim$10 GHz, with pulse energy exceeding 2.6 pJ and a high peak power beyond 0.5 W. We show that both the repetition rate and the carrier-envelope-offset of the resulting frequency comb can be flexibly controlled in a wide range using the RF driving frequency and the pump current, paving the way for fully-stabilized on-chip frequency combs in nanophotonics. Our work marks an important step toward fully-integrated nonlinear and ultrafast photonic systems in nanophotonic lithium niobate.</td>

<td align="center">Using anonymized mobility data from Facebook users and publicly available information on the Italian population, we model the circulation of people in Italy before and during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19). We perform a spatial and temporal clustering of the movement network at the level of fluxes across provinces on a daily basis. The resulting partition in time successfully identifies the first two lockdowns without any prior information. Similarly, the spatial clustering returns 11 to 23 clusters depending on the period ("standard" mobility vs. lockdown) using the greedy modularity communities clustering method, and 16 to 30 clusters using the critical variable selection method. Fascinatingly, the spatial clusters obtained with both methods are strongly reminiscent of the 11 regions into which emperor Augustus had divided Italy according to Pliny the Elder. This work introduces and validates a data analysis pipeline that enables us: i) to assess the reliability of data obtained from a partial and potentially biased sample of the population in performing estimates of population mobility nationwide; ii) to identify areas of a Country with well-defined mobility patterns, and iii) to distinguish different patterns from one another, resolve them in time and find their optimal spatial extent. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to other countries, with different geographical scales, and also to similar networks (e.g. biological networks). The results can thus represent a relevant step forward in the development of methods and strategies for the containment of future epidemic phenomena.</td>

<td align="center">Neutrino scattering and absorption rates of relevance to supernovae and neutron star mergers are obtained from nuclear matter dynamical structure functions that encode many-body effects from nuclear mean fields and correlations. We employ nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory to calculate the density, spin, isospin, and spin-isospin response functions of warm beta-equilibrium nuclear matter. We include corrections to the single-particle energies in the mean field approximation as well as vertex corrections resummed in the random phase approximation (RPA), including, for the first time, both direct and exchange diagrams. We find that correlations included through the RPA redistribute the strength of the response to higher energy for neutrino absorption and lower energy for antineutrino absorption. This tends to suppress the absorption rate of electron neutrinos across all relevant energy scales. In contrast, the inclusion of RPA correlations enhances the electron antineutrino absorption rate at low energy and supresses the rate at high energy. These effects are especially important at high-density and in the vicinity of the neutrino decoupling region. Implications for heavy element nucleosynthesis, electromagnetic signatures of compact object mergers, supernova dynamics, and neutrino detection from galactic supernovae are discussed briefly.</td>

Additionally, a non-autoregressive (NAR) decoder and a language change detection (LCD) module are employed to assist in training. Evaluated on the SEAME corpus, our method achieves a state-of-the-art mixed error rate (MER) of 16.29% and 22.81% on the test_man and test_sge sets.

A finite set of statistics called sigma points, sampled deterministically, provides a more informative and lower-variance posterior representation than the ubiquitous noise-scaling of the reparameterization trick, while ensuring higher-quality reconstruction. We further boost the performance by replacing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the Wasserstein distribution metric that allows for a sharper posterior. Inspired by the two components, we derive a novel, deterministic-sampling flavor of the VAE, the Unscented Autoencoder (UAE), trained purely with regularization-like terms on the per-sample posterior.

However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p&lt;0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p&lt;0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.</td>

In this paper, we propose an audio-text-based end-to-end model architecture for flexible keyword spotting (KWS), which builds upon learned audio and text embeddings. Our architecture uses a novel dynamic programming-based algorithm, Dynamic Sequence Partitioning (DSP), to optimally partition the audio sequence into the same length as the word-based text sequence using the monotonic alignment of spoken content. Our proposed model consists of an encoder block to get audio and text embeddings, a projector block to project individual embeddings to a common latent space, and an audio-text aligner containing a novel DSP algorithm, which aligns the audio and text embeddings to determine if the spoken content is the same as the text. Experimental results show that our DSP is more effective than other partitioning schemes, and the proposed architecture outperformed the state-of-the-art results on the public dataset in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Equal-Error-Rate (EER) by 14.4 % and 28.9%, respectively.</td>

More precisely, (i) each neuron of the network, i.e., a linear threshold function, is converted to a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD), and (ii) they are further combined into some final form, such as Boolean circuits. For a linear threshold function with $n$ variables, an existing method takes $O(n2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ time to construct an ordered BDD of size $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ consistent with some variable ordering. However, it is non-trivial to choose a variable ordering producing a small BDD among $n!$ candidates.   We propose a method to convert a linear threshold function to a specific form of a BDD based on the boosting approach in the machine learning literature. Our method takes $O(2^n \text{poly}(1/\rho))$ time and outputs BDD of size $O(\frac{n^2}{\rho^4}\ln{\frac{1}{\rho}})$, where $\rho$ is the margin of some consistent linear threshold function. Our method does not need to search for good variable orderings and produces a smaller expression when the margin of the linear threshold function is large. More precisely, our method is based on our new boosting algorithm, which is of independent interest. We also propose a method to combine them into the final Boolean expression representing the neural network.</td>

We develop the Noether-Wald procedure in this context and exhibit the conserved charges as explicit integrals of motion, in the sense that they can be computed at any radius on the rotating spacetime. The boundary conditions needed to solve the first order differential equations are discussed in great detail. We extremize the entropy function that controls the near horizon geometry and give explicit formulae for all geometric variables at their supersymmetric extrema. We have also considered a complexification of the near-horizon variables that elucidates some features of the theory from the near-horizon perspective.</td>

The branching fractions obtained are $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to \eta e^{+} \nu_e)$ = $(2.251\pm0.039_{\rm stat.}\pm 0.051_{\rm syst.})\%$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to \eta^{\prime} e^{+} \nu_e)$ = $(0.810\pm0.038_{\rm stat.}\pm 0.024_{\rm syst.})\%$.

<td align="center">Shape restriction, like monotonicity or convexity, imposed on a function of interest, such as a regression or density function, allows for its estimation without smoothness assumptions. The concept of $k$-monotonicity encompasses a family of shape restrictions, including decreasing and convex decreasing as special cases corresponding to $k=1$ and $k=2$. We consider Bayesian approaches to estimate a $k$-monotone density. By utilizing a kernel mixture representation and putting a Dirichlet process or a finite mixture prior on the mixing distribution, we show that the posterior contraction rate in the Hellinger distance is $(n/\log n)^{- k/(2k + 1)}$ for a $k$-monotone density, which is minimax optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. When the true $k$-monotone density is a finite $J_0$-component mixture of the kernel, the contraction rate improves to the nearly parametric rate $\sqrt{(J_0 \log n)/n}$. Moreover, by putting a prior on $k$, we show that the same rates hold even when the best value of $k$ is unknown. A specific application in modeling the density of $p$-values in a large-scale multiple testing problem is considered. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.</td>

<td align="center">Federated Machine Learning (FL) has received considerable attention in recent years. FL benchmarks are predominantly explored in either simulated systems or data center environments, neglecting the setups of real-world systems, which are often closely linked to edge computing. We close this research gap by introducing FLEdge, a benchmark targeting FL workloads in edge computing systems. We systematically study hardware heterogeneity, energy efficiency during training, and the effect of various differential privacy levels on training in FL systems. To make this benchmark applicable to real-world scenarios, we evaluate the impact of client dropouts on state-of-the-art FL strategies with failure rates as high as 50%. FLEdge provides new insights, such as that training state-of-the-art FL workloads on older GPU-accelerated embedded devices is up to 3x more energy efficient than on modern server-grade GPUs.</td>

<td align="center">We consider the problem of optimizing a grey-box objective function, i.e., nested function composed of both black-box and white-box functions. A general formulation for such grey-box problems is given, which covers the existing grey-box optimization formulations as special cases. We then design an optimism-driven algorithm to solve it. Under certain regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves similar regret bound as that for the standard black-box Bayesian optimization algorithm, up to a constant multiplicative term depending on the Lipschitz constants of the functions considered. We further extend our method to the constrained case and discuss several special cases. For the commonly used kernel functions, the regret bounds allow us to derive a convergence rate to the optimal solution. Experimental results show that our grey-box optimization method empirically improves the speed of finding the global optimal solution significantly, as compared to the standard black-box optimization algorithm.</td>

<td align="center">Reconstructing category-specific objects from a single image is a challenging task that requires inferring the geometry and appearance of an object from a limited viewpoint. Existing methods typically rely on local feature retrieval based on re-projection with known camera intrinsic, which are slow and prone to distortion at viewpoints distant from the input image. In this paper, we present Variable Radiance Field (VRF), a novel framework that can efficiently reconstruct category-specific objects from a single image without known camera parameters. Our key contributions are: (1) We parameterize the geometry and appearance of the object using a multi-scale global feature extractor, which avoids frequent point-wise feature retrieval and camera dependency. We also propose a contrastive learning-based pretraining strategy to improve the feature extractor. (2) We reduce the geometric complexity of the object by learning a category template, and use hypernetworks to generate a small neural radiance field for fast and instance-specific rendering. (3) We align each training instance to the template space using a learned similarity transformation, which enables semantic-consistent learning across different objects. We evaluate our method on the CO3D dataset and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and speed. We also demonstrate its applicability to shape interpolation and object placement tasks.</td>

<td align="center">We introduce Mesogeos, a large-scale multi-purpose dataset for wildfire modeling in the Mediterranean. Mesogeos integrates variables representing wildfire drivers (meteorology, vegetation, human activity) and historical records of wildfire ignitions and burned areas for 17 years (2006-2022). It is designed as a cloud-friendly spatio-temporal dataset, namely a datacube, harmonizing all variables in a grid of 1km x 1km x 1-day resolution. The datacube structure offers opportunities to assess machine learning (ML) usage in various wildfire modeling tasks. We extract two ML-ready datasets that establish distinct tracks to demonstrate this potential: (1) short-term wildfire danger forecasting and (2) final burned area estimation given the point of ignition. We define appropriate metrics and baselines to evaluate the performance of models in each track. By publishing the datacube, along with the code to create the ML datasets and models, we encourage the community to foster the implementation of additional tracks for mitigating the increasing threat of wildfires in the Mediterranean.</td>

<td align="center">This paper presents a modeling framework to optimize the two-dimensional placement of powertrain elements inside the vehicle, explicitly accounting for the rotation, relative placement and alignment. Specifically, we first capture the multi-level nature of the system mathematically, and construct a model that captures different powertrain component orientations. Second, we include the relative element placement as variables in the model and derive alignment constraints for both child components and parent subsystems to automatically connect mechanical ports. Finally, we showcase our framework on a four-wheel driven electric vehicle. Our results demonstrate that our framework is capable of efficiently generating system design solutions in a fully automated manner, only using basic component properties.</td>
