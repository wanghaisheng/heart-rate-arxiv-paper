|**2023-06-06**|**SciCap+: A Knowledge Augmented Dataset to Study the Challenges of Scientific Figure Captioning**|Zhishen Yang et.al.|[2306.03491v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03491v1)|[link](https://github.com/zhishenyang/scientific_figure_captioning_dataset)|In scholarly documents, figures provide a straightforward way of communicating scientific findings to readers. Automating figure caption generation helps move model understandings of scientific documents beyond text and will help authors write informative captions that facilitate communicating scientific findings. Unlike previous studies, we reframe scientific figure captioning as a knowledge-augmented image captioning task that models need to utilize knowledge embedded across modalities for caption generation. To this end, we extended the large-scale SciCap dataset~\cite{hsu-etal-2021-scicap-generating} to SciCap+ which includes mention-paragraphs (paragraphs mentioning figures) and OCR tokens. Then, we conduct experiments with the M4C-Captioner (a multimodal transformer-based model with a pointer network) as a baseline for our study. Our results indicate that mention-paragraphs serves as additional context knowledge, which significantly boosts the automatic standard image caption evaluation scores compared to the figure-only baselines. Human evaluations further reveal the challenges of generating figure captions that are informative to readers. The code and SciCap+ dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZhishenYang/scientific_figure_captioning_dataset|

Unfortunately, this is not always ensured, as poor scan quality and the resulting artifacts lead to errors in the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. Current approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks show promising results for background removal tasks but fail correcting artifacts like pixelation or compression errors. For general images, Transformer backbones are getting integrated more frequently in well-known neural network structures for denoising tasks. In this work, a modified UNet structure using a Swin Transformer backbone is presented to remove typical artifacts in scanned documents. Multi-headed cross-attention skip connections are used to more selectively learn features in respective levels of abstraction. The performance of this approach is examined regarding compression errors, pixelation and random noise. An improvement in text extraction quality with a reduced error rate of up to 53.9% on the synthetic data is archived. The pretrained base-model can be easily adapted to new artifacts. The cross-attention skip connections allow to integrate textual information extracted from the encoder or in form of commands to more selectively control the models outcome. The latter is shown by means of an example application.|
|**2023-06-03**|**TransDocAnalyser: A Framework for Offline Semi-structured Handwritten Document Analysis in the Legal Domain**|Sagar Chakraborty et.al.|[2306.02142v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02142v1)|[link](https://github.com/legaldocumentprocessing/fir_dataset_icdar2023)|State-of-the-art offline Optical Character Recognition (OCR) frameworks perform poorly on semi-structured handwritten domain-specific documents due to their inability to localize and label form fields with domain-specific semantics. Existing techniques for semi-structured document analysis have primarily used datasets comprising invoices, purchase orders, receipts, and identity-card documents for benchmarking. In this work, we build the first semi-structured document analysis dataset in the legal domain by collecting a large number of First Information Report (FIR) documents from several police stations in India. This dataset, which we call the FIR dataset, is more challenging than most existing document analysis datasets, since it combines a wide variety of handwritten text with printed text. We also propose an end-to-end framework for offline processing of handwritten semi-structured documents, and benchmark it on our novel FIR dataset. Our framework used Encoder-Decoder architecture for localizing and labelling the form fields and for recognizing the handwritten content. The encoder consists of Faster-RCNN and Vision Transformers. Further the Transformer-based decoder architecture is trained with a domain-specific tokenizer. We also propose a post-correction method to handle recognition errors pertaining to the domain-specific terms. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the FIR dataset outperforming several existing models|
|**2023-06-02**|**DocFormerv2: Local Features for Document Understanding**|Srikar Appalaraju et.al.|[2306.01733v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01733v1)|null|We propose DocFormerv2, a multi-modal transformer for Visual Document Understanding (VDU). The VDU domain entails understanding documents (beyond mere OCR predictions) e.g., extracting information from a form, VQA for documents and other tasks. VDU is challenging as it needs a model to make sense of multiple modalities (visual, language and spatial) to make a prediction. Our approach, termed DocFormerv2 is an encoder-decoder transformer which takes as input - vision, language and spatial features. DocFormerv2 is pre-trained with unsupervised tasks employed asymmetrically i.e., two novel document tasks on encoder and one on the auto-regressive decoder. The unsupervised tasks have been carefully designed to ensure that the pre-training encourages local-feature alignment between multiple modalities. DocFormerv2 when evaluated on nine datasets shows state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines e.g. TabFact (4.3%), InfoVQA (1.4%), FUNSD (1%). Furthermore, to show generalization capabilities, on three VQA tasks involving scene-text, Doc- Formerv2 outperforms previous comparably-sized models and even does better than much larger models (such as GIT2, PaLi and Flamingo) on some tasks. Extensive ablations show that due to its pre-training, DocFormerv2 understands multiple modalities better than prior-art in VDU.|
|**2023-06-01**|**Layout and Task Aware Instruction Prompt for Zero-shot Document Image Question Answering**|Wenjin Wang et.al.|[2306.00526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00526v1)|[link](https://github.com/wenjinw/latin-prompt)|The pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm based on layout-aware multimodal pre-trained models has achieved significant progress on document image question answering. However, domain pre-training and task fine-tuning for additional visual, layout, and task modules prevent them from directly utilizing off-the-shelf instruction-tuning language foundation models, which have recently shown promising potential in zero-shot learning. Contrary to aligning language models to the domain of document image question answering, we align document image question answering to off-the-shell instruction-tuning language foundation models to utilize their zero-shot capability. Specifically, we propose layout and task aware instruction prompt called LATIN-Prompt, which consists of layout-aware document content and task-aware descriptions. The former recovers the layout information among text segments from OCR tools by appropriate spaces and line breaks. The latter ensures that the model generates answers that meet the requirements, especially format requirements, through a detailed description of task. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that LATIN-Prompt can improve the zero-shot performance of instruction-tuning language foundation models on document image question answering and help them achieve comparable levels to SOTAs based on the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm. Quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of LATIN-Prompt. We provide the code in supplementary and will release the code to facilitate future research.|
|**2023-05-31**|**Improving Handwritten OCR with Training Samples Generated by Glyph Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model**|Haisong Ding et.al.|[2305.19543v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19543v1)|null|Constructing a highly accurate handwritten OCR system requires large amounts of representative training data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to collect. To mitigate the issue, we propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate training samples. This model conditions on a printed glyph image and creates mappings between printed characters and handwritten images, thus enabling the generation of photo-realistic handwritten samples with diverse styles and unseen text contents. However, the text contents in synthetic images are not always consistent with the glyph conditional images, leading to unreliable labels of synthetic samples. To address this issue, we further propose a progressive data filtering strategy to add those samples with a high confidence of correctness to the training set. Experimental results on IAM benchmark task show that OCR model trained with augmented DDPM-synthesized training samples can achieve about 45% relative word error rate reduction compared with the one trained on real data only.|
|**2023-05-30**|**DuoSearch: A Novel Search Engine for Bulgarian Historical Documents**|Angel Beshirov et.al.|[2305.19392v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19392v1)|[link](https://github.com/angelbeshirov/duosearch)|Search in collections of digitised historical documents is hindered by a two-prong problem, orthographic variety and optical character recognition (OCR) mistakes. We present a new search engine for historical documents, DuoSearch, which uses ElasticSearch and machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to offer a solution to this problem. It was tested on a collection of historical newspapers in Bulgarian from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. The system provides an interactive and intuitive interface for the end-users allowing them to enter search terms in modern Bulgarian and search across historical spellings. This is the first solution facilitating the use of digitised historical documents in Bulgarian.|
|**2023-05-29**|**GlyphControl: Glyph Conditional Control for Visual Text Generation**|Yukang Yang et.al.|[2305.18259v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18259v1)|[link](https://github.com/aigtext/glyphcontrol-release)|Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based text-to-image generative models capable of generating coherent and well-formed visual text. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient approach called GlyphControl to address this task. Unlike existing methods that rely on character-aware text encoders like ByT5 and require retraining of text-to-image models, our approach leverages additional glyph conditional information to enhance the performance of the off-the-shelf Stable-Diffusion model in generating accurate visual text. By incorporating glyph instructions, users can customize the content, location, and size of the generated text according to their specific requirements. To facilitate further research in visual text generation, we construct a training benchmark dataset called LAION-Glyph. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by measuring OCR-based metrics and CLIP scores of the generated visual text. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GlyphControl outperforms the recent DeepFloyd IF approach in terms of OCR accuracy and CLIP scores, highlighting the efficacy of our method.|
|**2023-05-28**|**FuseCap: Leveraging Large Language Models to Fuse Visual Data into Enriched Image Captions**|Noam Rotstein et.al.|[2305.17718v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17718v1)|[link](https://github.com/RotsteinNoam/FuseCap)|Image captioning is a central task in computer vision which has experienced substantial progress following the advent of vision-language pre-training techniques. In this paper, we highlight a frequently overlooked limitation of captioning models that often fail to capture semantically significant elements. This drawback can be traced back to the text-image datasets; while their captions typically offer a general depiction of image content, they frequently omit salient details. To mitigate this limitation, we propose FuseCap - a novel method for enriching captions with additional visual information, obtained from vision experts, such as object detectors, attribute recognizers, and Optical Character Recognizers (OCR). Our approach fuses the outputs of such vision experts with the original caption using a large language model (LLM), yielding enriched captions that present a comprehensive image description. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed caption enrichment method through both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our method is then used to curate the training set of a captioning model based BLIP which surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches in generating accurate and detailed captions while using significantly fewer parameters and training data. As additional contributions, we provide a dataset comprising of 12M image-enriched caption pairs and show that the proposed method largely improves image-text retrieval.|
|**2023-05-27**|**Exploring Better Text Image Translation with Multimodal Codebook**|Zhibin Lan et.al.|[2305.17415v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17415v2)|[link](https://github.com/deeplearnxmu/mc_tit)|Text image translation (TIT) aims to translate the source texts embedded in the image to target translations, which has a wide range of applications and thus has important research value. However, current studies on TIT are confronted with two main bottlenecks: 1) this task lacks a publicly available TIT dataset, 2) dominant models are constructed in a cascaded manner, which tends to suffer from the error propagation of optical character recognition (OCR). In this work, we first annotate a Chinese-English TIT dataset named OCRMT30K, providing convenience for subsequent studies. Then, we propose a TIT model with a multimodal codebook, which is able to associate the image with relevant texts, providing useful supplementary information for translation. Moreover, we present a multi-stage training framework involving text machine translation, image-text alignment, and TIT tasks, which fully exploits additional bilingual texts, OCR dataset and our OCRMT30K dataset to train our model. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and training framework.|
|**2023-05-27**|**Super-Resolution of License Plate Images Using Attention Modules and Sub-Pixel Convolution Layers**|Valfride Nascimento et.al.|[2305.17313v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17313v1)|[link](https://github.com/valfride/lpr-rsr-ext)|Recent years have seen significant developments in the field of License Plate Recognition (LPR) through the integration of deep learning techniques and the increasing availability of training data. Nevertheless, reconstructing license plates (LPs) from low-resolution (LR) surveillance footage remains challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) approach that integrates attention and transformer modules to enhance the detection of structural and textural features in LR images. Our approach incorporates sub-pixel convolution layers (also known as PixelShuffle) and a loss function that uses an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for feature extraction. We trained the proposed architecture on synthetic images created by applying heavy Gaussian noise to high-resolution LP images from two public datasets, followed by bicubic downsampling. As a result, the generated images have a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of less than 0.10. Our results show that our approach for reconstructing these low-resolution synthesized images outperforms existing ones in both quantitative and qualitative measures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/valfride/lpr-rsr-ext/|
|**2023-05-26**|**People and Places of Historical Europe: Bootstrapping Annotation Pipeline and a New Corpus of Named Entities in Late Medieval Texts**|Vít Novotný et.al.|[2305.16718v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16718v2)|null|Although pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models are highly accurate on modern corpora, they underperform on historical texts due to differences in language OCR errors. In this work, we develop a new NER corpus of 3.6M sentences from late medieval charters written mainly in Czech, Latin, and German.   We show that we can start with a list of known historical figures and locations and an unannotated corpus of historical texts, and use information retrieval techniques to automatically bootstrap a NER-annotated corpus. Using our corpus, we train a NER model that achieves entity-level Precision of 72.81-93.98% with 58.14-81.77% Recall on a manually-annotated test dataset. Furthermore, we show that using a weighted loss function helps to combat class imbalance in token classification tasks. To make it easy for others to reproduce and build upon our work, we publicly release our corpus, models, and experimental code.|
|**2023-05-24**|**Quantifying Character Similarity with Vision Transformers**|Xinmei Yang et.al.|[2305.14672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14672v1)|[link](https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/quantifying-character-similarity)|Record linkage is a bedrock of quantitative social science, as analyses often require linking data from multiple, noisy sources. Off-the-shelf string matching methods are widely used, as they are straightforward and cheap to implement and scale. Not all character substitutions are equally probable, and for some settings there are widely used handcrafted lists denoting which string substitutions are more likely, that improve the accuracy of string matching. However, such lists do not exist for many settings, skewing research with linked datasets towards a few high-resource contexts that are not representative of the diversity of human societies. This study develops an extensible way to measure character substitution costs for OCR'ed documents, by employing large-scale self-supervised training of vision transformers (ViT) with augmented digital fonts. For each language written with the CJK script, we contrastively learn a metric space where different augmentations of the same character are represented nearby. In this space, homoglyphic characters - those with similar appearance such as ``O'' and ``0'' - have similar vector representations. Using the cosine distance between characters' representations as the substitution cost in an edit distance matching algorithm significantly improves record linkage compared to other widely used string matching methods, as OCR errors tend to be homoglyphic in nature. Homoglyphs can plausibly capture character visual similarity across any script, including low-resource settings. We illustrate this by creating homoglyph sets for 3,000 year old ancient Chinese characters, which are highly pictorial. Fascinatingly, a ViT is able to capture relationships in how different abstract concepts were conceptualized by ancient societies, that have been noted in the archaeological literature.|
|**2023-05-21**|**Measuring Intersectional Biases in Historical Documents**|Nadav Borenstein et.al.|[2305.12376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12376v1)|[link](https://github.com/copenlu/intersectional-bias-pbw)|Data-driven analyses of biases in historical texts can help illuminate the origin and development of biases prevailing in modern society.   However, digitised historical documents pose a challenge for NLP practitioners as these corpora suffer from errors introduced by optical character recognition (OCR) and are written in an archaic language. In this paper, we investigate the continuities and transformations of bias in historical newspapers published in the Caribbean during the colonial era (18th to 19th centuries). Our analyses are performed along the axes of gender, race, and their intersection. We examine these biases by conducting a temporal study in which we measure the development of lexical associations using distributional semantics models and word embeddings. Further, we evaluate the effectiveness of techniques designed to process OCR-generated data and assess their stability when trained on and applied to the noisy historical newspapers. We find that there is a trade-off between the stability of the word embeddings and their compatibility with the historical dataset. We provide evidence that gender and racial biases are interdependent, and their intersection triggers distinct effects. These findings align with the theory of intersectionality, which stresses that biases affecting people with multiple marginalised identities compound to more than the sum of their constituents.|
|**2023-05-19**|**XTREME-UP: A User-Centric Scarce-Data Benchmark for Under-Represented Languages**|Sebastian Ruder et.al.|[2305.11938v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11938v2)|[link](https://github.com/google-research/xtreme-up)|Data scarcity is a crucial issue for the development of highly multilingual NLP systems. Yet for many under-represented languages (ULs) -- languages for which NLP re-search is particularly far behind in meeting user needs -- it is feasible to annotate small amounts of data. Motivated by this, we propose XTREME-UP, a benchmark defined by: its focus on the scarce-data scenario rather than zero-shot; its focus on user-centric tasks -- tasks with broad adoption by speakers of high-resource languages; and its focus on under-represented languages where this scarce-data scenario tends to be most realistic. XTREME-UP evaluates the capabilities of language models across 88 under-represented languages over 9 key user-centric technologies including ASR, OCR, MT, and information access tasks that are of general utility. We create new datasets for OCR, autocomplete, semantic parsing, and transliteration, and build on and refine existing datasets for other tasks. XTREME-UP provides methodology for evaluating many modeling scenarios including text-only, multi-modal (vision, audio, and text),supervised parameter tuning, and in-context learning. We evaluate commonly used models on the benchmark. We release all code and scripts to train and evaluate models|
|**2023-05-18**|**TextDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Text Painters**|Jingye Chen et.al.|[2305.10855v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10855v3)|[link](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/textdiffuser)|Diffusion models have gained increasing attention for their impressive generation abilities but currently struggle with rendering accurate and coherent text. To address this issue, we introduce TextDiffuser, focusing on generating images with visually appealing text that is coherent with backgrounds. TextDiffuser consists of two stages: first, a Transformer model generates the layout of keywords extracted from text prompts, and then diffusion models generate images conditioned on the text prompt and the generated layout. Additionally, we contribute the first large-scale text images dataset with OCR annotations, MARIO-10M, containing 10 million image-text pairs with text recognition, detection, and character-level segmentation annotations. We further collect the MARIO-Eval benchmark to serve as a comprehensive tool for evaluating text rendering quality. Through experiments and user studies, we show that TextDiffuser is flexible and controllable to create high-quality text images using text prompts alone or together with text template images, and conduct text inpainting to reconstruct incomplete images with text. The code, model, and dataset will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/textdiffuser}.|
|**2023-05-16**|**Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training with Unified Modality Masking for Visual Document Understanding**|Shuwei Feng et.al.|[2305.10448v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10448v1)|null|This paper presents GenDoc, a general sequence-to-sequence document understanding model pre-trained with unified masking across three modalities: text, image, and layout. The proposed model utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture, which allows for increased adaptability to a wide range of downstream tasks with diverse output formats, in contrast to the encoder-only models commonly employed in document understanding. In addition to the traditional text infilling task used in previous encoder-decoder models, our pre-training extends to include tasks of masked image token prediction and masked layout prediction. We also design modality-specific instruction and adopt both disentangled attention and the mixture-of-modality-experts strategy to effectively capture the information leveraged by each modality. Evaluation of the proposed model through extensive experiments on several downstream tasks in document understanding demonstrates its ability to achieve superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis further suggests that GenDoc is more robust than the encoder-only models in scenarios where the OCR quality is imperfect.|
|**2023-05-16**|**Mobile User Interface Element Detection Via Adaptively Prompt Tuning**|Zhangxuan Gu et.al.|[2305.09699v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09699v1)|[link](https://github.com/antmachineintelligence/mui-zh)|Recent object detection approaches rely on pretrained vision-language models for image-text alignment. However, they fail to detect the Mobile User Interface (MUI) element since it contains additional OCR information, which describes its content and function but is often ignored. In this paper, we develop a new MUI element detection dataset named MUI-zh and propose an Adaptively Prompt Tuning (APT) module to take advantage of discriminating OCR information. APT is a lightweight and effective module to jointly optimize category prompts across different modalities. For every element, APT uniformly encodes its visual features and OCR descriptions to dynamically adjust the representation of frozen category prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play APT upon several existing CLIP-based detectors for both standard and open-vocabulary MUI element detection. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves considerable improvements on two datasets. The datasets is available at \url{github.com/antmachineintelligence/MUI-zh}.|
|**2023-05-13**|**On the Hidden Mystery of OCR in Large Multimodal Models**|Yuliang Liu et.al.|[2305.07895v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07895v3)|[link](https://github.com/yuliang-liu/multimodalocr)|Large models have recently played a dominant role in natural language processing and multimodal vision-language learning. It remains less explored about their efficacy in text-related visual tasks. We conducted a comprehensive study of existing publicly available multimodal models, evaluating their performance in text recognition (document text, artistic text, handwritten text, scene text), text-based visual question answering (document text, scene text, and bilingual text), key information extraction (receipts, documents, and nutrition facts) and handwritten mathematical expression recognition. Our findings reveal strengths and weaknesses in these models, which primarily rely on semantic understanding for word recognition and exhibit inferior perception of individual character shapes. They also display indifference towards text length and have limited capabilities in detecting finegrained features in images. Consequently, these results demonstrate that even the current most powerful large multimodal models cannot match domain-specific methods in traditional text tasks and face greater challenges in more complex tasks. Most importantly, the baseline results showcased in this study could provide a foundational framework for the conception and assessment of innovative strategies targeted at enhancing zero-shot multimodal techniques. Evaluation pipeline is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MultimodalOCR.|
|**2023-05-12**|**Visual Information Extraction in the Wild: Practical Dataset and End-to-end Solution**|Jianfeng Kuang et.al.|[2305.07498v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07498v1)|[link](https://github.com/jfkuang/cfam)|Visual information extraction (VIE), which aims to simultaneously perform OCR and information extraction in a unified framework, has drawn increasing attention due to its essential role in various applications like understanding receipts, goods, and traffic signs. However, as existing benchmark datasets for VIE mainly consist of document images without the adequate diversity of layout structures, background disturbs, and entity categories, they cannot fully reveal the challenges of real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a large-scale dataset consisting of camera images for VIE, which contains not only the larger variance of layout, backgrounds, and fonts but also much more types of entities. Besides, we propose a novel framework for end-to-end VIE that combines the stages of OCR and information extraction in an end-to-end learning fashion. Different from the previous end-to-end approaches that directly adopt OCR features as the input of an information extraction module, we propose to use contrastive learning to narrow the semantic gap caused by the difference between the tasks of OCR and information extraction. We evaluate the existing end-to-end methods for VIE on the proposed dataset and observe that the performance of these methods has a distinguishable drop from SROIE (a widely used English dataset) to our proposed dataset due to the larger variance of layout and entities. These results demonstrate our dataset is more practical for promoting advanced VIE algorithms. In addition, experiments demonstrate that the proposed VIE method consistently achieves the obvious performance gains on the proposed and SROIE datasets.|
|**2023-05-11**|**Combining OCR Models for Reading Early Modern Printed Books**|Mathias Seuret et.al.|[2305.07131v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07131v1)|[link](https://github.com/seuretm/combined-ocr)|In this paper, we investigate the usage of fine-grained font recognition on OCR for books printed from the 15th to the 18th century. We used a newly created dataset for OCR of early printed books for which fonts are labeled with bounding boxes. We know not only the font group used for each character, but the locations of font changes as well. In books of this period, we frequently find font group changes mid-line or even mid-word that indicate changes in language. We consider 8 different font groups present in our corpus and investigate 13 different subsets: the whole dataset and text lines with a single font, multiple fonts, Roman fonts, Gothic fonts, and each of the considered fonts, respectively. We show that OCR performance is strongly impacted by font style and that selecting fine-tuned models with font group recognition has a very positive impact on the results. Moreover, we developed a system using local font group recognition in order to combine the output of multiple font recognition models, and show that while slower, this approach performs better not only on text lines composed of multiple fonts but on the ones containing a single font only as well.|
|**2023-05-09**|**E2TIMT: Efficient and Effective Modal Adapter for Text Image Machine Translation**|Cong Ma et.al.|[2305.05166v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05166v2)|[link](https://github.com/ericongma/e2timt)|Text image machine translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded in images from one source language to another target language. Existing methods, both two-stage cascade and one-stage end-to-end architectures, suffer from different issues. The cascade models can benefit from the large-scale optical character recognition (OCR) and MT datasets but the two-stage architecture is redundant. The end-to-end models are efficient but suffer from training data deficiency. To this end, in our paper, we propose an end-to-end TIMT model fully making use of the knowledge from existing OCR and MT datasets to pursue both an effective and efficient framework. More specifically, we build a novel modal adapter effectively bridging the OCR encoder and MT decoder. End-to-end TIMT loss and cross-modal contrastive loss are utilized jointly to align the feature distribution of the OCR and MT tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the existing two-stage cascade models and one-stage end-to-end models with a lighter and faster architecture. Furthermore, the ablation studies verify the generalization of our method, where the proposed modal adapter is effective to bridge various OCR and MT models.|
|**2023-05-04**|**Text Reading Order in Uncontrolled Conditions by Sparse Graph Segmentation**|Renshen Wang et.al.|[2305.02577v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02577v1)|null|Text reading order is a crucial aspect in the output of an OCR engine, with a large impact on downstream tasks. Its difficulty lies in the large variation of domain specific layout structures, and is further exacerbated by real-world image degradations such as perspective distortions. We propose a lightweight, scalable and generalizable approach to identify text reading order with a multi-modal, multi-task graph convolutional network (GCN) running on a sparse layout based graph. Predictions from the model provide hints of bidimensional relations among text lines and layout region structures, upon which a post-processing cluster-and-sort algorithm generates an ordered sequence of all the text lines. The model is language-agnostic and runs effectively across multi-language datasets that contain various types of images taken in uncontrolled conditions, and it is small enough to be deployed on virtually any platform including mobile devices.|
|**2023-05-03**|**Evaluating BERT-based Scientific Relation Classifiers for Scholarly Knowledge Graph Construction on Digital Library Collections**|Ming Jiang et.al.|[2305.02291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02291v1)|null|The rapid growth of research publications has placed great demands on digital libraries (DL) for advanced information management technologies. To cater to these demands, techniques relying on knowledge-graph structures are being advocated. In such graph-based pipelines, inferring semantic relations between related scientific concepts is a crucial step. Recently, BERT-based pre-trained models have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification. Despite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different scenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are primarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of early scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character recognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn creating uncertainty about existing classifiers' performances. To address these limitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean corpora. Given these parallel corpora, we conducted a thorough empirical evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three factors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise impacts. Experiments on clean data show that the domain-specific pre-trained Bert is the best variant to identify scientific relations. The strategy of predicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously identifying multiple relations in general. The optimal classifier's performance can decline by around 10% to 20% in F-score on the noisy corpora. Insights discussed in this study can help DL stakeholders select techniques for building optimal knowledge-graph-based systems.|

Although the recent LLaMA-Adapter demonstrates the potential to handle visual inputs with LLMs, it still cannot generalize well to open-ended visual instructions and lags behind GPT-4. In this paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual instruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking more learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the instruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters. Secondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into the early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation. Thirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and instruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of learnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference between the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and achieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and instruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models (e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image understanding capability without incurring training costs. Compared to the original LLaMA-Adapter, our LLaMA-Adapter V2 can perform open-ended multi-modal instructions by merely introducing 14M parameters over LLaMA. The newly designed framework also exhibits stronger language-only instruction-following capabilities and even excels in chat interactions.

The majority of the research work conducted on this topic to date follow a two-step pipeline. First, they read the text using an off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine, then, they extract the fields of interest from the obtained text. The main drawback of these approaches is their dependence on an external OCR system, which can negatively impact both performance and computational speed. Recent OCR-free methods were proposed to address the previous issues. Inspired by their promising results, we propose in this paper an OCR-free end-to-end information extraction model named DocParser. It differs from prior end-to-end approaches by its ability to better extract discriminative character features. DocParser achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets, while still being faster than previous works.|

However, this important element is commonly found in official and financial scenarios, and has not received the attention it deserves in the field of OCR technology. To promote research in this area, we organized ICDAR 2023 competition on reading the seal title (ReST), which included two tasks: seal title text detection (Task 1) and end-to-end seal title recognition (Task 2). We constructed a dataset of 10,000 real seal data, covering the most common classes of seals, and labeled all seal title texts with text polygons and text contents. The competition opened on 30th December, 2022 and closed on 20th March, 2023. The competition attracted 53 participants from academia and industry including 28 submissions for Task 1 and 25 submissions for Task 2, which demonstrated significant interest in this challenging task. In this report, we present an overview of the competition, including the organization, challenges, and results. We describe the dataset and tasks, and summarize the submissions and evaluation results. The results show that significant progress has been made in the field of seal title text reading, and we hope that this competition will inspire further research and development in this important area of OCR technology.|

However, distinguishing short video rumors poses a significant challenge due to the substantial amount of information and shared features among videos, resulting in homogeneity. To address the dissemination of short video rumors effectively, our research group proposes a methodology encompassing multimodal feature fusion and the integration of external knowledge, considering the merits and drawbacks of each algorithm. The proposed detection approach entails the following steps: (1) creation of a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple features extracted from short videos; (2) development of a multimodal rumor detection model: first, we employ the Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) video coding model to extract video features, followed by the utilization of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extract textual features. Subsequently, the BERT model is employed to fuse textual and video features; (3) distinction is achieved through contrast learning: we acquire external knowledge by crawling relevant sources and leverage a vector database to incorporate this knowledge into the classification output. Our research process is driven by practical considerations, and the knowledge derived from this study will hold significant value in practical scenarios, such as short video rumor identification and the management of social opinions.|

This research work focuses on improving the optical character recognition (OCR) with ML techniques with integration of OCR with long short-term memory (LSTM) based sequence to sequence deep learning models to perform document translation. This work is based on ANKI dataset for English to Spanish translation. In this work, I have shown comparative study for pre-trained OCR while using deep learning model using LSTM-based seq2seq architecture with attention for machine translation.

Most widely used methods do not employ deep learning and do not exploit the inherently multimodal nature of documents. Notably, record linkage is typically conceptualized as a string-matching problem. This study develops CLIPPINGS, (Contrastively Linking Pooled Pre-trained Embeddings), a multimodal framework for record linkage. CLIPPINGS employs end-to-end training of symmetric vision and language bi-encoders, aligned through contrastive language-image pre-training, to learn a metric space where the pooled image-text representation for a given instance is close to representations in the same class and distant from representations in different classes. At inference time, instances can be linked by retrieving their nearest neighbor from an offline exemplar embedding index or by clustering their representations. The study examines two challenging applications: constructing comprehensive supply chains for mid-20th century Japan through linking firm level financial records - with each firm name represented by its crop in the document image and the corresponding OCR - and detecting which image-caption pairs in a massive corpus of historical U.S. newspapers came from the same underlying photo wire source. CLIPPINGS outperforms widely used string matching methods by a wide margin and also outperforms unimodal methods. Moreover, a purely self-supervised model trained on only image-OCR pairs also outperforms popular string-matching methods without requiring any labels.|
